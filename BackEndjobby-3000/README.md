# 🎩✨ JOBBY-3000 ✨🎩

Welcome, traveler, to the enchanted land of **JOBBY-3000** — where census scrolls are read, trade schools sing their statistics, and graphs dance merrily upon your screen.  

This project is a grand two-part symphony: a wise **BackEndjobby-3000** that consults the mighty **U.S. Census Oracle**, and a sprightly **jobby-3000** frontend that paints tales of data in vivid colors for mortal eyes to see.
